# Facial-Expression-Detection
A web application that detects facial expression real time. Uses OpenCV's haarcascade frontal face model to extract face bounding boxes from input frames and passes it to a DNN trained to classify facial expression. Inspired by Goodfellow, I.J., et.al. (2013). Challenged in representation learning: A report of three machine learning contests. Neural Networks, 64, 59-63. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.0414.pdf
